# brian_xor
Solution to XOR problem using spiking neural networks. 
However, this is old code, and it uses ineficient methods, and bad coding principles.
Please refer to my other repository instead for a feedforward multilayer spike-based classifier
that solves the XoR problem, and hopefully the Iris benchmark: https://github.com/syntapy/normad
